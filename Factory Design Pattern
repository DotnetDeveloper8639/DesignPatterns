Factory Design Pattern:
-----------------------
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, 
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Defines an interface for creating an object, but leaves the choice of its type to the subclasses.
Subclasses implement the factory method to produce objects of a specific type.


public interface IFactory
{
    IProduct CreateProduct();
}

public class ConcreteFactoryA : IFactory
{
    public IProduct CreateProduct()
    {
        return new ConcreteProductA();
    }
}

public class ConcreteFactoryB : IFactory
{
    public IProduct CreateProduct()
    {
        return new ConcreteProductB();
    }
}
